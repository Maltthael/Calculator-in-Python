## Calculator Master

 What this code does

- Performs the four basic math operations.
- Displays the result of the calculation.
- Handles errors such as:
  - division by zero  
  - non-numeric input  
  - invalid operator

There is no front-end and no database.  
This project focuses only on the raw back-end logic.
